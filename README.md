# weather-app

This app is intended to practice my skills with APIs. I did a great deal of studying callbacks, promises and async/await beforehand and applied the knowledge garnered to hit the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) and deliver weather data for an inputted city. Just type a city like "San Francisco" or "London" and hit the Search button. I kept styling simple with [Pico](https://picocss.com/) and used Webpack.
